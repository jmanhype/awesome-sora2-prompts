prompt: |
  Subject/Character:
  Simplified silhouette figure rendered in dark watercolor, loose brushstroke edges,
  flowing dress or coat painted with transparent washes, minimal facial detail,
  dreamlike and abstract representation rather than realistic depiction.

  Action/Motion:
  Slow graceful walk through transforming landscape, figure fading in and out
  of opacity, colors bleeding from figure into environment, smooth flowing motion
  like ink spreading on wet paper, elements dissolving and reforming.

  Environment/Setting:
  Abstract watercolor landscape constantly morphing, suggested trees and hills
  made from loose brushstrokes, sky bleeding into ground with gradient washes,
  floating color clouds, visible paper texture throughout, no hard edges anywhere,
  palette of blues, purples, soft pinks, and muted greens.

  Cinematic Framing:
  Slow horizontal tracking at walking pace, camera movement feeling organic
  and hand-painted, soft focus aesthetic, dreamy depth of field effect,
  figure centered with environment flowing around them.

  Aesthetic/Style:
  Traditional watercolor animation technique, visible brush textures and paper grain,
  transparent color overlays creating depth, wet-on-wet blending effects,
  color bleeds at edges, no outlines or hard shapes, soft atmospheric lighting,
  impressionistic rather than detailed, emphasis on mood and color harmony.

camera:
  lens: "50mm animation camera"
  movement: "slow smooth horizontal tracking, organic handheld feel"
  framing: "medium shot, centered figure, soft focus dreamlike"
