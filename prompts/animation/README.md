## Contributing

See the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on submitting animation prompts.

**Animation Category Requirements**:
- Clear artistic style or animation technique
- Stylization that's distinctly non-photorealistic
- Design elements that prioritize aesthetics
- Creative use of color, shape, or texture
- Can reference traditional animation methods (cel animation, stop-motion, 2D)

**Good Examples**:
- Stop-motion inspired scenes with craft materials
- Cel-shaded 3D animation with bold linework
- Watercolor or painted aesthetics
- Paper craft or collage styles
- Stylized 3D with artistic rendering

**Avoid**:
- Photorealistic rendering
- Generic "3D animation" without style specificity
- Vague descriptions like "cartoon style" without details
- Physics-accurate simulations (use hyperrealism instead)
