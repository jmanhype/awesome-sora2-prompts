  [Subject/Character - Pillar 1]
  A simple paper cutout character - small humanoid figure with rounded features,
  cut from bright orange construction paper. The character has visible paper texture,
  clean cut edges, and flat 2D form with no shading, just solid color. Simple dot eyes
  and curved smile give friendly expression. Character stands about 2 inches tall in scale.

  [Action/Motion - Pillar 2]
  The paper character walks from left to right across the scene with simple, rhythmic
  step animation. Each step has slight vertical bounce, evoking classic walk cycle.
  Character moves at steady, cheerful pace. Arms swing slightly with each step.
  The walk has stop-motion quality with subtle frame-by-frame imperfections that add charm.
  Multiple forest layers move at different speeds behind character, creating parallax effect.

  [Environment/Setting - Pillar 3]
  Multi-layered paper forest scene with distinct depth planes. Foreground: dark green
  paper grass with hand-cut irregular edges. Middle ground: tree trunks in brown and
  tan, simple cylindrical shapes. Background: lighter green paper trees and bushes,
  progressively lighter colors for distance. Sky is pale blue paper. Each layer is
  clearly separate, creating forced perspective through color and scale. Visible paper
  texture throughout. White background shows between layers.

  [Cinematic Framing - Pillar 4]
  50mm lens equivalent for animation camera. Side-view profile shot, camera tracking
  horizontally following character's movement at constant speed. Character stays center
  frame while background layers move at different rates (parallax scrolling). Medium shot
  showing character full body with surrounding environment. Static vertical positioning,
  only horizontal camera tracking. Flat, even lighting with no dramatic shadows.

  [Aesthetic/Style - Pillar 5]
  Handcrafted paper cutout animation aesthetic inspired by stop-motion and children's
  book illustrations. Bright, saturated colors with visible paper texture and grain.
  Clean cut edges with slight imperfections. Flat lighting to emphasize 2D nature.
  No gradient shading - only solid colors. Slight frame-by-frame variation creates
  charming handmade quality. Whimsical and cheerful tone. Color palette: orange character,
  green forest tones, blue sky, brown/tan wood. Matte finish on all paper elements.
