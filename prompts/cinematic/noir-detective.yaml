  [Subject/Character - Pillar 1]
  A trench-coated detective in a fedora, face half-lit by neon signs.
  Weathered features, stubble, tired eyes scanning the street with world-weary vigilance.
  Navy trench coat collar turned up against the rain.

  [Action/Motion - Pillar 2]
  The detective walks slowly through rain-slicked streets at night, each footstep
  deliberate and measured. Camera follows from behind with a smooth tracking shot
  at walking pace. Puddles ripple as footsteps disturb the water. Occasional head turn
  to check side alleys.

  [Environment/Setting - Pillar 3]
  City street at midnight. Heavy rain creating sheets of water. Neon signs
  reflect in wet pavement - red, green, amber lights creating streaks of color.
  Distant streetlights create pools of amber light. Empty sidewalk. Steam rises
  from subway grates. Mist hangs in the air. Depth: Detective in foreground,
  blurred city lights in background fading into misty darkness.

  [Cinematic Framing - Pillar 4]
  35mm lens. Medium shot from behind, third-person perspective, camera positioned
  at shoulder height. Slow tracking movement follows detective at consistent
  walking pace, maintaining 8-10 feet distance. Shallow depth of field keeps
  focus on detective's silhouette, background softly blurred with bokeh effect
  from neon lights.

  [Aesthetic/Style - Pillar 5]
  High contrast noir lighting with deep blacks and bright highlights.
  Film grain texture reminiscent of 1940s detective films. Color palette:
  deep blues dominate shadows, amber streetlights, neon reds and greens
  punctuate the darkness. Cinematic film stock aesthetic with slight vignette.
  Moody, atmospheric, emphasizing isolation and mystery.
