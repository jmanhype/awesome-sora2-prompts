summary: >
  Normal urban scene progressively corrupted by digital glitch effects,
  RGB color channel separation, datamoshing, pixel sorting, reality fragmenting
  into digital artifacts, experimental video art aesthetic.

prompt: |
  Subject/Character:
  Person walking down normal city street, appearance gradually corrupted
  by glitch effects, figure fragmenting into RGB channels that separate and drift,
  pixel-sorted streaks replacing body parts, form dissolving into data.

  Action/Motion:
  Normal walking motion increasingly disrupted by time glitches and frame skips,
  movements stuttering and repeating, body parts lagging behind in different
  color channels, smooth motion transitioning to fragmented digital artifacts,
  reality breaking down into component data streams.

  Environment/Setting:
  Contemporary urban street starting normal then progressively corrupted,
  buildings experiencing RGB channel separation and drift apart, datamosh compression
  artifacts spreading across scene, pixel sorting creating vertical streaks,
  environment fragmenting into abstract digital patterns.

  Cinematic Framing:
  Starts as stable locked camera position, progressively corrupted by
  screen tearing and position glitches, frame jumps and stutters,
  multiple overlapping frames creating temporal displacement, camera itself
  becoming part of the glitch aesthetic.

  Aesthetic/Style:
  Digital glitch art aesthetic, intentional video compression artifacts,
  RGB color channel separation and offset, datamoshing techniques, pixel sorting
  creating vertical streaks, temporal displacement effects, scan line distortion,
  digital noise and corruption, abstract digital expressionism, vaporwave influence,
  beauty in digital degradation.

camera:
  lens: "50mm"
  movement: "locked position degrading into glitchy unstable tracking"
  framing: "medium shot corrupting into abstract framing"
