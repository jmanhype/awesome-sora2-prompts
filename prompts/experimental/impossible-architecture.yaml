summary: >
  Camera navigating through M.C. Escher-inspired impossible architecture,
  stairs leading in contradictory directions, gravity-defying structures,
  seamless transitions between incompatible perspectives, geometric impossibility.

prompt: |
  Subject/Character:
  No human subjects - focus entirely on architectural space itself as protagonist,
  impossible geometric structures forming maze-like environment, stairs and columns
  connecting in physically impossible ways, clean modernist surfaces in paradoxical
  arrangements.

  Action/Motion:
  Continuous smooth camera movement through impossible spaces, traveling up stairs
  that lead back to starting point, perspective shifts revealing contradictory
  spatial relationships, seamless transitions between incompatible orientations,
  gravity direction changing based on camera perspective.

  Environment/Setting:
  Infinite void filled with impossible geometric architecture, clean white marble
  or concrete surfaces, dramatic shadows creating depth, Escher-like paradoxical
  spaces, columns and arches connecting in ways that violate Euclidean geometry,
  minimalist color palette emphasizing form and shadow.

  Cinematic Framing:
  Smooth steadicam-like continuous shot navigating through space, camera serving
  as viewer proxy exploring impossibility, perspective shifts key to revealing
  paradoxes, wide angle emphasizing spatial relationships and architectural scale.

  Aesthetic/Style:
  M.C. Escher lithograph aesthetic translated to 3D, high-contrast dramatic lighting,
  clean geometric forms, impossible perspective manipulation, mathematical precision
  in contradictory spatial relationships, philosophical exploration of perception
  and reality, monochromatic or limited color palette, emphasis on shadow and form,
  surrealist architectural dreamscape.

  lens: "24mm wide angle"
