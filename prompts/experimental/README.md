## Available Prompts

### Digital Data Dissolution

**Summary**: Abstract visualization of 3D wireframe cityscape dissolving into cascading data particles, glitch effects, vaporwave aesthetic, experimental digital art style with impossible physics.

**Tags**: `experimental` `abstract` `glitch` `digital` `data` `vaporwave` `cyberpunk` `particle` `transformation` `surreal`

**Camera**: 24mm wide angle | Slow upward crane with intentional glitch effects | Low angle, wide shot

**Demo**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=example-data-dissolution)

**File**: [`data-dissolution.yaml`](data-dissolution.yaml)

### Reality Glitch Aesthetic

**Summary**: Normal urban scene progressively corrupted by digital glitch effects, RGB color channel separation, datamoshing, pixel sorting, reality fragmenting into digital artifacts, experimental video art aesthetic.

**Tags**: `experimental` `glitch` `digital` `corruption` `abstract` `datamosh` `RGB-shift` `distortion` `avant-garde` `digital-art`

**Camera**: 50mm lens | Locked position degrading into glitchy tracking | Medium shot corrupting into abstract

**Demo**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=example-glitch-aesthetic)

**File**: [`glitch-aesthetic.yaml`](glitch-aesthetic.yaml)

### Impossible Architecture Exploration

**Summary**: Camera navigating through M.C. Escher-inspired impossible architecture, stairs leading in contradictory directions, gravity-defying structures, seamless transitions between incompatible perspectives.

**Tags**: `experimental` `architecture` `impossible` `escher` `surreal` `geometric` `paradox` `perspective` `mind-bending` `abstract`

**Camera**: 24mm wide angle | Smooth continuous tracking through impossible spaces | Wide shot emphasizing spatial impossibility

**Demo**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=example-impossible-architecture)

## Contributing

See the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on submitting experimental prompts.

**Experimental Category Requirements**:
- Must demonstrate innovation or boundary-pushing concepts
- Can include impossible physics or surreal elements
- Should explore Sora 2's capabilities in unique ways
- Can be abstract or conceptual
- Technical experimentation encouraged

**Good Examples**:
- Abstract data visualizations
- Impossible architecture or physics
- Glitch art and digital aesthetics
- Surreal dreamscapes
- Time manipulation effects
- Novel visual techniques

**Avoid**:
- Standard commercial or conventional work
- Simply "weird for weird's sake" without artistic intent
- Prompts that fit better in other categories
- Lazy abstraction without clear vision

**Note**: This category has the most creative freedom, but quality and intentionality still matter. Experimentation should be purposeful, not random.
