summary: >
  Abstract visualization of 3D wireframe cityscape dissolving into cascading data particles,
  glitch effects, vaporwave aesthetic, experimental digital art style with impossible physics.

prompt: |
  [Subject/Character - Pillar 1]
  A geometric 3D wireframe cityscape rendered in bright cyan and magenta lines.
  The city consists of cubic buildings with visible edge lines, no solid surfaces,
  only glowing wireframe outlines. Grid-like structure with digital precision.
  Buildings range from small to skyscraper height, creating dense urban silhouette.
  All lines pulse with digital energy.

  [Action/Motion - Pillar 2]
  The wireframe cityscape begins stable, then progressively dissolves from top to bottom.
  Building edges break apart into individual data particles - small glowing cubes and
  points that cascade downward like digital rain. Particles fall in streams, some
  defying gravity by floating or moving laterally. Glitch effects appear intermittently:
  horizontal scan lines, RGB color separation, pixelated distortion. The dissolution
  accelerates, creating waterfall effect of data. Some particles coalesce into abstract
  forms before dispersing again.

  [Environment/Setting - Pillar 3]
  Abstract digital void space with deep purple gradient background transitioning to
  black at edges. Grid floor extends to infinity rendered in faint cyan lines.
  No physical light sources - everything is self-illuminated with neon glow.
  Depth created through particle density and atmospheric perspective. Occasional
  digital artifacts float in background: floating text fragments, error messages,
  geometric shapes. Surreal space without physical rules.

  [Cinematic Framing - Pillar 4]
  Wide angle lens 24mm. Low angle shot looking up at cityscape, camera positioned
  below grid floor level. Slow upward crane movement as dissolution occurs, creating
  sense of being engulfed by falling data. Wide framing shows multiple buildings and
  particle streams. Deep depth of field keeps everything in relative focus.
  Slight handheld-like digital jitter adds to glitch aesthetic. Camera movement
  occasionally stutters or jumps frames intentionally.

  [Aesthetic/Style - Pillar 5]
  Experimental vaporwave-meets-cyberpunk aesthetic with heavy emphasis on synthetic
  digital appearance. Color palette: cyan, magenta, purple, black with occasional
  yellow accents. High contrast, oversaturated colors. Bloom and glow effects on
  all bright elements. Intentional glitch artifacts: scan lines, chromatic aberration,
  pixel sorting, data moshing. VHS tracking errors and digital compression artifacts
  appear periodically. Impossible physics - particles behave in anti-gravity ways.
  Surreal, dreamlike quality. Nostalgic 80s/90s computer graphics aesthetic filtered
  through modern rendering.

camera:
  lens: "24mm wide angle"
  movement: "slow upward crane movement with intentional digital jitter and frame stuttering"
  framing: "low angle looking up, wide shot showing cityscape and particle streams, deep depth of field"

audio_notes: "Synthesizer drones with deep bass. Digital glitch sounds, data stream effects, high-pitched sine waves. Rhythmic electronic beat in background. Occasional pitched-down vocal samples. Vaporwave style ambient electronic music. No dialogue."
