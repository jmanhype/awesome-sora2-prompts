### Urban Glass Architecture Reflection

**Summary**: Extreme detail shot of modern glass skyscraper facade reflecting clouds and sky, perfect geometric patterns, subtle lens distortion, natural daylight, photorealistic material rendering of glass, steel, and concrete.

**Tags**: `hyperrealism` `architecture` `glass` `reflection` `urban` `daylight` `modern` `geometric` `photorealistic` `building`

**Camera**: 50mm lens | slow upward tilt, minimal camera movement | close-up to medium shot, geometric composition

**Demo**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=example-urban-architecture)

### Morning Coffee Pour

**Summary**: Extreme close-up of dark coffee being poured into white ceramic mug, steam rising, light refracting through liquid, macro lens capturing every detail in photorealistic quality.

**Tags**: `hyperrealism` `coffee` `steam` `close-up` `macro` `kitchen` `morning` `physics` `liquid` `photorealistic`

**Camera**: 100mm macro lens | static tripod shot, locked position, no camera movement | extreme close-up, slightly elevated 15-degree angle, shallow depth of field, center composition
