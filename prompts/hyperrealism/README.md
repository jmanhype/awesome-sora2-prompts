# Hyperrealism Prompts 📸

Photorealistic simulations emphasizing material accuracy and physics. Focus on detail, realism, and natural phenomena.

## Characteristics
- Photorealistic detail and rendering
- Physics accuracy (materials, forces, dynamics)
- Natural lighting and reflections
- Real-world plausibility
- Material-specific behaviors

**Requirements**: Must include `physics` field with materials and forces.

## Contributing

See the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on submitting hyperrealism prompts.

**Hyperrealism Category Requirements**:
- Must specify materials (liquids, metals, fabrics, etc.)
- Must specify forces (gravity, friction, tension, etc.)
- Photorealistic rendering quality
- Natural lighting and accurate reflections
- Physics must be plausible (no impossible effects)

**Good Examples**:
- Macro shots of natural phenomena (water, fire, smoke)
- Product photography with material detail
- Natural environments with lighting accuracy
- Physics-based simulations (cloth, liquid, particles)

**Avoid**:
- Stylized or artistic interpretations
- Impossible physics or surreal elements
- Cartoon or animation aesthetics
- Vague material descriptions
