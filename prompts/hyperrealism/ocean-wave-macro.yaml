tags: [hyperrealism, ocean, wave, macro, water, physics, nature, close-up, photorealistic, fluid-dynamics]
summary: >
  Extreme macro shot of ocean wave crest about to break, water droplets suspended in air,
  sunlight refracting through translucent water, foam texture detail,
  physics-accurate fluid dynamics captured at high frame rate.

prompt: |
  Subject/Character:
  Turquoise ocean wave at breaking point, water forming curved crest,
  spray droplets suspended mid-air catching sunlight, foam bubbles with
  varying sizes and translucency levels, pristine water clarity.

  Action/Motion:
  Wave approaching breaking point in slow motion, water curling forward,
  droplets separating from crest and hanging in air, foam building at base,
  subtle internal water movement visible through translucent sections.

  Environment/Setting:
  Open ocean on sunny day, bright natural sunlight from behind wave creating
  backlit translucent effect, clear blue water, minimal visible horizon,
  focus entirely on wave detail and immediate water environment.

  Cinematic Framing:
  Extreme macro shot at wave height, camera positioned at water level,
  high-speed slow motion capture, locked position tracking with wave movement,
  shallow depth of field on crest with background blur.

  Aesthetic/Style:
  Hyperrealistic nature documentary style, natural color saturation,
  high dynamic range preserving highlight detail in water and foam,
  crystal clear sharpness on water droplets, professional surf photography aesthetic,
  emphasis on revealing water physics normally invisible to naked eye.
