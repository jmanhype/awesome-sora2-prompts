summary: >
  Extreme close-up of dark coffee being poured into white ceramic mug, steam rising,
  light refracting through liquid, macro lens capturing every detail in photorealistic quality.

  [Subject/Character - Pillar 1]
  A stream of freshly brewed dark coffee pouring from a chrome coffee pot spout.
  The coffee appears rich brown-black with subtle amber highlights where light passes through.
  A white ceramic mug with smooth glazed surface sits below, empty at start.

  [Action/Motion - Pillar 2]
  Coffee pours in a steady stream from the spout into the mug. The liquid hits the bottom
  of the mug, creating small splashes and ripples. As the mug fills, foam begins to form
  on the surface. Steam rises in delicate wisps from the hot liquid, curling and dissipating
  into the air. The stream remains consistent throughout, showing realistic fluid dynamics.

  [Environment/Setting - Pillar 3]
  Kitchen counter scene in soft morning light. Window light enters from the left side,
  creating warm illumination. The counter surface is light marble with subtle veining.
  Shallow depth of field - only the pour and mug are in sharp focus, background softly
  blurred showing hints of kitchen items. Warm color temperature suggesting early morning.

  [Cinematic Framing - Pillar 4]
  Macro lens 100mm. Extreme close-up shot positioned at mug rim level, slightly elevated
  angle looking down at 15 degrees. Camera is static and stable, locked on tripod.
  Framing centers the coffee stream and mug, filling most of frame. Shallow depth of field
  with focus on the point where coffee enters mug, chrome spout and mug rim sharp,
  background bokeh. Fixed focal plane throughout shot.

  [Aesthetic/Style - Pillar 5]
  Photorealistic hyperrealism with emphasis on material accuracy. High dynamic range
  capturing both dark coffee tones and bright reflections on chrome. Realistic light
  refraction through semi-transparent coffee at edges of stream. Steam rendered with
  volumetric accuracy, showing proper dissipation and light scattering. Surface tension
  visible in liquid. Film-like color grading with slightly warm color temperature.
  Professional product photography aesthetic.

camera:
  lens: "100mm macro"
  movement: "static tripod shot, locked position, no camera movement"
  framing: "extreme close-up, slightly elevated 15-degree angle, shallow depth of field, center composition"

physics:
  materials:
    - liquid coffee
    - ceramic mug
    - chrome metal
    - steam vapor
    - marble counter
  forces:
    - gravity pulling coffee stream down
    - liquid surface tension in mug
    - fluid dynamics of splash and ripples
    - steam rising from heat
    - light refraction through semi-transparent liquid

audio_notes: "Steady stream of liquid pouring into ceramic, subtle hollow echo as mug fills, very faint steam hiss, quiet morning ambience, no music."
