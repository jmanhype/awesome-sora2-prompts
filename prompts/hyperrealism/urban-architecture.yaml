prompt: |
  Subject/Character:
  Modern glass curtain wall skyscraper facade, floor-to-ceiling windows in perfect grid,
  polished chrome mullions, subtle imperfections in glass panels,
  reflections of passing clouds and adjacent buildings.

  Action/Motion:
  Subtle slow upward tilt revealing building height, clouds moving across
  reflected sky, slight wind causing minimal glass panel flex,
  changing light as clouds pass sun.

  Environment/Setting:
  Downtown urban environment on clear afternoon, strong natural daylight,
  dramatic cloud formations in blue sky, surrounding glass towers reflecting
  in subject building, concrete plaza at base.

  Cinematic Framing:
  Extreme close-up to medium shot showing facade detail, slow upward tilt,
  locked position with minimal movement, sharp focus throughout,
  geometric composition emphasizing grid patterns.

  Aesthetic/Style:
  Photorealistic architectural photography, natural color grading,
  high dynamic range capturing reflection and glass detail,
  minimal contrast adjustments, precise geometric rendering,
  professional real estate photography aesthetic.
