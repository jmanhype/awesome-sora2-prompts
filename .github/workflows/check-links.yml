            The link checker found one or more broken demo video links in this PR.

            **Please verify:**
            - All demo links are publicly accessible
            - Videos are hosted on supported platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
            - Links don't require authentication to view
            - Videos haven't been deleted or made private

            **To test locally:**
            \`\`\`bash
            pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
            python scripts/check_links.py prompts/category/your-prompt.yaml
            \`\`\`

            See the workflow logs above for details on which links failed.`
