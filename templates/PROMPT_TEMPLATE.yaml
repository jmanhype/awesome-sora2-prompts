# SORA 2 PROMPT TEMPLATE
# ============================================================================
# This template follows the AI Video Factory Constitution's Five-Pillar
# Prompt Engineering framework (Principle III - NON-NEGOTIABLE).
#
# Before submitting, validate locally:
#   python scripts/validate_prompts.py your-file.yaml
#
# See guides/five-pillars.md for detailed framework explanation.
# See CONTRIBUTING.md for step-by-step contribution instructions.
# ============================================================================

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REQUIRED FIELDS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

title: "Your Prompt Title Here (5-100 characters)"
# Keep it descriptive and specific. Good: "Noir Detective in Rain"
# Bad: "Cool Video" (too vague)

category: cinematic
# REQUIRED: Choose exactly ONE category:
#   - cinematic: Narrative-driven, story-focused prompts
#   - hyperrealism: Photorealistic scenes, documentary style
#   - animation: Stylized, illustrated, cartoon aesthetics
#   - experimental: Boundary-pushing, avant-garde techniques

tags: [example-tag, golden-hour, 35mm, slow-motion]
# REQUIRED: 1-12 unique tags in lowercase-with-hyphens format
# Use for discoverability via GitHub search
# Examples: noir, rain, night, detective, wide-angle, watercolor

summary: >
  Brief description of the visual outcome in 20-280 characters.
  Use folded block (>) for continuous paragraph. Think Twitter-length.
  Focus on what the viewer will see, not technical details.
# Good: "Trench-coated detective walks through rain-slicked streets, neon reflections, 35mm film grain"
# Bad: "A video about a detective" (too vague, fails Quality Gate per Principle V)

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FIVE-PILLAR PROMPT STRUCTURE (Principle III - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Use literal block (|) to preserve line structure.
# Address ALL five pillars explicitly in your prompt:
#
# Pillar 1: Subject & Character - Who/what is the focus?
# Pillar 2: Action & Motion - What happens? Camera and subject movement
# Pillar 3: Environment & Setting - Where? Time, weather, spatial depth
# Pillar 4: Cinematic Framing - How is it shot? Lens, angle, composition
# Pillar 5: Aesthetic & Style - Visual treatment? Lighting, color, film stock

prompt: |
  [Subject/Character - Pillar 1]
  A trench-coated detective in a fedora, face half-lit by neon signs.
  Weathered features, stubble, tired eyes scanning the street.

  [Action/Motion - Pillar 2]
  The detective walks slowly through rain-slicked streets at night.
  Camera follows from behind with a smooth tracking shot.
  Puddles ripple as footsteps disturb the water.

  [Environment/Setting - Pillar 3]
  City street at midnight. Heavy rain. Neon signs reflect in wet pavement.
  Distant streetlights create pools of amber light. Empty sidewalk.
  Mist rises from steam vents. Depth: Detective in foreground, blurred city lights in background.

  [Cinematic Framing - Pillar 4]
  35mm lens. Medium shot from behind, third-person perspective.
  Slow tracking movement follows detective at walking pace.
  Shallow depth of field keeps focus on detective, background softly blurred.

  [Aesthetic/Style - Pillar 5]
  High contrast noir lighting. Film grain texture.
  Color palette: deep blues, amber streetlights, neon reds and greens.
  Cinematic film stock aesthetic, reminiscent of 1940s detective films.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CAMERA SPECIFICATIONS (Required - Pillar 4)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

camera:
  lens: "35mm"
  # Examples: "24mm wide-angle", "50mm", "85mm", "telephoto", "fisheye"
  # Specific focal lengths preferred over generic terms

  movement: "slow tracking shot, follows from behind at walking pace"
  # Examples: "handheld shake", "smooth dolly", "static wide shot", "crane up"
  # Describe both camera movement and any subject movement

  framing: "medium shot, third-person perspective, shallow depth of field"
  # Examples: "close-up on face", "wide establishing shot", "over-the-shoulder",
  # "bird's eye view", "low angle looking up"

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL FIELDS (Recommended for Enhanced Quality)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Physics hints - STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for hyperrealism category
# Helps Sora 2 simulate realistic material interactions
physics:
  materials:
    - wet pavement
    - fabric coat
    - falling rain
    - glass windows
  # List materials present in scene. Examples: water, sand, fabric, glass, smoke, metal

  forces:
    - gravity on raindrops
    - coat fabric flow as detective walks
    - water ripples from footsteps
  # List forces affecting objects. Examples: wind, gravity, water flow, inertia

# Audio cues for Sora 2's synchronized audio generation
audio_notes: "Steady rain pattering on pavement. Distant jazz music from nearby club. Muffled footsteps on wet concrete. Occasional car passing in distance."
# Keep to 10-500 characters. Be specific but concise.
# Examples: "Ocean waves crashing, seagulls crying", "Crackling campfire, wind in trees"

# Expected video length
expected_duration: "6-8 seconds"
# Format: "X-Y seconds" (typical Sora 2 range is 3-20 seconds)
